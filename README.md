Project Evaluation + Reflection
-
This project, as mentioned before, was made during Hack Club’s Daydream Auckland and Daydream Global game jams. This game was inspired by the game jam’s theme “Sacrifices must be made” and our groupmate Arisu’s recent market day project where she sold hotdogs. 

### Challenges
- Challenge 1: Programming the “F to haul” and “X to sacrifice” functions. we learned how to implement node signals for body entering areas and key presses. This was one of the most difficult areas we had to complete.    
- Challenge 2: Animating cutscenes. we needed to use the Animation Player node to animate our cutscenes. Learned to use key frames, and property tracks. This was also used to create jumpscares. @AudreyS108    
- Challenge 3: Creating engaging gameplay: we wanted amazing gameplay and storyline to fit with the theme of “Sacrifices must be made”. To add some back story and lore, we added speech bubbles to allow the player to see some backstory of each character. We also added objectives and cutscenes to let the player know what to do.    
- Challenge 4: Designing sprites: this wasn’t an extremely difficult challenge but we still took lots of time to consider how to make the designs fit the game - cute but also unsettling.
