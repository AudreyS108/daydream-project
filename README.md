# Sausage Surprise 

About
-
This project is a web game created using the game engine Godot and GDScript. It was made for Hack Club’s Daydream Auckland game jam and Daydream Global event.

In this game you play as a hotdog who is given the difficult task of sacrificing 5 hotdogs (chosen from out of your 5 family members and yourself) to a giant human mouth. Who will you save and who will you sacrifice? 

**Game contains jumpscare.**

### How To Play
- Use controls WASD to move
- F to pick up a hotdog
- X to kill/sacrifice a hotdog

### Features
- Cutscenes created using the Animation Player (For storytelling and visuals)
- Handdrawn pixel art sprites  
- Unique audio features

### Game Credits
> Programmer + Scene creator + README/Description writer: Audrey   
> Artist + Sounds Creator + Music editor: Luke    
> Artist: Arisu (Created assets but not in-person at the Daydream Auckland event.)    

Project Evaluation + Reflection
-
This project, as mentioned before, was made during Hack Club’s Daydream Auckland and Daydream Global game jams. This game was inspired by the game jam’s theme “Sacrifices must be made” and our groupmate Arisu’s recent market day project where she sold hotdogs. Originally, I wanted to create a game for another Hack Club program featuring a platformer where to player is a hotdog, and asked Arisu to draw assets for me (which she happily agreed to). I never ended up doing that project because of a lack of time. However, after hearing about daydream, I decided to switch to working on a hotdog-related game in daydream instead. Instead of a platformer, we decided to make a game involving sacrificing hotdogs, to complement the "Sacrifices must be made" theme. (Game idea created by @AudreyS108)

### Challenges
- Challenge 1: Programming the “F to haul” and “X to sacrifice” functions. we learned how to implement node signals for body entering areas and key presses. This was one of the most difficult areas we had to complete. However, after overcoming this challenge, @AudreyS108 found it much easier to code, as we just had to apply the concepts learnt from the challenge to other parts of the game.   
- Challenge 2: GitHub problems. Early in game development we ran into several merge conflicts and push/pull issues. Over time though we learned how to use GitHub better, and we decided to only push and pull once or twice an hour to avoid more conflicts.
- Challenge 3: Animating cutscenes. We needed to use the Animation Player node to animate our cutscenes. Learned to use key frames, and property tracks. This was also used to create jumpscares. @AudreyS108     
- Challenge 4: Creating engaging gameplay: we wanted amazing gameplay and storyline to fit with the theme of “Sacrifices must be made”. To add some back story and lore, we added speech bubbles to allow the player to see some backstory of each character. We also added objectives and cutscenes to let the player know what to do.    
- Challenge 5: Designing sprites: this wasn’t an extremely difficult challenge but we still took lots of time to consider how to make the designs fit the game - cute but also unsettling.
